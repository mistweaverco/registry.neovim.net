This is a registry for Neovim plugins and themes, built with love by the community.

## Why?

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and
easy way to find and share Neovim plugins and themes.

It is heavily inspired by the sublime text package control registry.

One day, we might even have a package manager for Neovim that
can use this registry to find and install plugins and themes.

Until then, we hope this registry will be a useful resource for
the community.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!

If you have a plugin or theme that you would like to add,
please open an issue or a pull request.
